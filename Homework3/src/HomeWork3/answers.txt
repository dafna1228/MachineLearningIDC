1.	In general, why do we expect feature scaling to have a positive effect on our kNN algorithm?
Would we expect to have a positive effect of feature scaling in the context of decision tree algorithms?


2.	In class we saw we can perform an edited kNN algorihtm which used either backward or forward kNN to filter out instances.
Could we use this procedure for our dataset? If so explain how, if not explain why.
